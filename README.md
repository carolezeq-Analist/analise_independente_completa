# analise_independente_completa
This project presents an independent spatial analysis of land use and land cover changes in the municipality of Terenos, Mato Grosso do Sul (BRASIL). Fully located within the Cerrado biome, using open data from the MapBiomas platform.
The study compares the years 2019 and 2024, highlighting territorial dynamics related to pasture dominance, agricultural expansion, silviculture growth, and the spatial behavior of urban areas. The maps were produced in a GIS environment, with careful cartographic design to ensure clear visualization and interpretation of the data.
In addition to 2D thematic maps, a 3D visual representation was developed to enhance spatial perception and improve communication of landscape patterns. The 3D model has an exploratory and visual purpose, complementing the analytical results without altering the original data classification.
This project demonstrates the application of open geospatial data for territorial analysis, environmental monitoring, and decision-support studies at the municipal scale.
